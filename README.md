**Bloc Jams** is a streaming music player with media queries to determine the viewer's display dimensions and a responsive, grid-based user interface to provide an optimized look for various viewing device display sizes.

  * The home page features text shadowing and CSS transition animations for a (literally) moving user experience. Graphics from the Ionicons font library are also used here for the musical notes, radio wave, and mobile device images.  

  * The Collection page, accessed via the link in the upper right corner of the home page, presents a set of albums. Each album reference includes artist, album title, song count, and album art. Selecting an album loads the album page. (At this time all entries are duplicates of a single album.)

  * The Album page includes album data from the Collection page, plus a track list with track number, title, and duration. A player control with play/pause, track back, track forward, and sliders for controlling the position of the currently playing track and the volume level appears at the bottom in a semi-transparent overlay. Hovering over a track number causes a play icon to appear in the track number's place and a pause button appears in the same position for the currently playing track. The Buzz audio library is used to load, play, and present representations of meta data for audio files.

## **Technologies Used**
